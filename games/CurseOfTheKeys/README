2) --------------------

To start the game, simply run start.py.

The goal of the game is to collect all three
cursed keys that are distributed all over the
kingdom of Kurzur. With these keys, you are
able to get to the nameless wizard which threatens
the kingdom and beat him.

There are 4 regions, in every but the one
you started you will find one key.


- MOVEMENT:

To move around, use the arrow keys.

Press s on the world map to toggle music on/off

Press ESC on the world map to toggle fullscreen on/off

Press SPACE to enter a location

- LOCATIONS:

Village:	Here you can hire new warriors and buy rations.
Settlement:	Like village, but more expensive and you can also
		hire new followers.
Capital city:	If you run out of gold/warriors/rations, the major of
		the city will help you out.
Ruin/Fortress:	I don't know, maybe you should investigate.

- FOLLOWERS:

Scout: 		makes you move faster.
Carrier:	you lose only half your gold/rations when
		you lose a fight.
Miracle heal: 	revives your fallen warriors sometimes.
Wizard: 	destroys enemies sometimes.
Ship: 		you can move on water.
Navigator:	you can move faster on water.

- RATIONS:

Every month, your warriors need food, so you should buy rations sometimes

3) --------------------------

You will fight every time with all of your warriors,
you can not choose how many will fight.

The game is much, much more faster.

There is no extra screen that tells you when a month
has passed.

There is no option to search a ruin 'carefully' or
'not carefully'

And some other things........

4) --------------------------

There are some options in src/options.py

The is not finished yet, there is still some
work to do, like optimizing the ugly code or
improving the graphics
