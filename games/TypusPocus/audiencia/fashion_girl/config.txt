# By setting "noLimits_"+layername to "yes" means that you do not have to 
# remove the above layers of clothes before changing this layer (e.g. would
# be silly to have to remove a jacket to have to change the shoes, or 
# visa-versa) Also it means that this layer is not only not effected by 
# other clothes layers, it's does not affect other clothes layers. This 
# means that where it is in the layer stack only effects the plotting
# of the article!
