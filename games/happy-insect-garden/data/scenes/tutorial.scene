Hi there! Welcome to Happy Insect Garden.

--

This is a nice looking patch... bit plain though. If you were a master gardener like me you'd have a rose bush here.

--

It looks like you don't have quite enough compost though. You'll need 200 to plant a rose bush.

--

Those earwigs look like a good source of compost. Maybe if you had some bees they'd collect 'em up for you.

Click somewhere in the garden to plant some honeysuckle. That should attract some bees.
