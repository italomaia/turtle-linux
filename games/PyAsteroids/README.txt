===================
A) Running the game
===================

[Source]:

To run the source code you need:

Python 2.4  -  http://www.python.org/
PyGame 1.7  -  http://www.pygame.org/

Once the above are installed, double click
on PyAsteroids.pyw.

[Windows]:

Double-click on PyAsteroids.exe.

[Mac]:

There is currently not a MacOSX version
of this game.



===================
B) How to play
===================

[Controls]:
-----------

Rotate: Left and Right Arrows
Accelerate/Deccelerate: Up and Down Arrows
Shoot: Spacebar


[Objective]:
------------

The object of the game is to shoot the asteroids
and enemy alien drones until you run out of shield.


[Menu Navigation]:
------------------

On the main menu, click New Game to start a new game.
A new screen will appear on which you will have to
choose a ship to play as. Each ship varies in it's stats.
When you highlight a ship, a stat box will appear at the
the left part of the screen, showing the ship's statistics.
Some of these can be modified, while others will mantain
their value throughout the game.


On the main menu, click Options to enter the options menu.
Here you can change the sound and music volume, and select
a different music track to listen to during gameplay.


Press Escape while playing to open the Pause Menu.
Here you can change the options, and enter cheats.
Note: If you cheat(except changing the music) the game
will not save your highscore.

Here's a few cheats:

Machine gun      - uhhhh
Rapid fire       - Maximum reload bar
Hey speedo!      - Maximum boost bar
Harm me not!     - Invulnerability
Medic!           - Full shield bar
Out of gas       - Full fuel bar


[Gameplay]:
-----------

Rotate your ship around and shoot the asteroids
to score points. Sometimes a drone will appear. 
It will shoot at you with lasers, and some of them
will try to ram into you, dealing massive damage.
Shoot at it to destroy it. Asteroids and drones have
hitpoints, which means it'll take a few shots to destroy
them. If you get hit by an asteroid, drone, or an enemy laser, 
you'll lose part of your shield.

Accelerating and deccelerating decreases your fuel.
When you're out of fuel, you will not be able to accelerate
or deccelerate, and will move only on inertia.

The two bars at the top left of the screen show how much
shield and fuel you have left.

The four bars at the bottom right part of the screen show
your ship's stats. These stats can be powered up by
powerups to boost the level of your ship.

Here are the stats that can be powered up:

Reload time: The more the bar, the less reload time.
Fuel tanks:  The more the bar, the less fuel you lose.
Shield Eff.: The more the bar, the less shield you lose.
Boost:       The more the bar, the faster you boost.

Sometimes the asteroids or drones will drop powerups
when you destory them. Grab them to powerup your ship!

Each of these bars increase when you get a powerup, depending
on the powerup. Here are the powerups and what they do:

Green  (L): Shortens reload time
Blue   (S): Increases your shield and increases Shield Eff.
Orange (F): Fills your fuel tanks and increases fuel tank size
Yellow (B): Increases boost speed.
