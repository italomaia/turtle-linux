How to play
-----------

Happy Insect Garden is a game of garden defence. You must plant flowers and
vegetables to attract good-hearted insect kind to your aid to fend off their
evil brethren.

Creatures are attracted to various attributes of the plants you place, including
colour, flowers and fruits, and may be repelled by others. Devise your garden carefully to get the right insects in the right place at the right time.

The game can be controlled entirely with the mouse. The plant and status menus
in game can be toggled with the space bar and plants can be selected with
hotkeys.

To get straight into the game select "Play Game" from the menu and then click on
the first garden (the "tutorial" garden).
