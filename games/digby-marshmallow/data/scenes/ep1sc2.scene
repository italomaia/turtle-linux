I'd collected a decent haul, a few things I might be able to sell on, so I went to see Truffles at his office in Space City. 
Truffles to his friends, Lord Pigsbury was his public face and the best fence in town. He knew it too and would often ask a favour before he bought a stash.

"Digby my man, splendiferous to see you, old bean."
Truffles never gave a compliment without taking a favour. This was going to be a big one.

I showed him the haul.
"Wonderful collection, old fruit, but I'm afraid I may be out of the fencing business. Seems my maiden aunt Hogatha has misplaced her finest pearl necklace. She's been poking around, and if she doesn't find them soon, I may have to retire to protect the family name."

--

I sighed.
"What do you need, Truffles?"
"Knew you were always keen to help a friend in need, Digby. Word on the street is that Davy Jones has been hawking pearls in the Atlantis Nebula."

And so I was on my way, to undersea adventure, and maybe one more big score.
