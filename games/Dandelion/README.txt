HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Dandelion is a series of mini-games about the life of a dandelion.

Controls:

 * Cursor keys.


Hints for each stage:

Title Screen: Press any key to detach and start flying.

Flying in the Wind: Collect the lens flares.

Winter: Collect the green warmth of the earth. Avoid the snowflakes as
    they drag you down. (You can still rise up if this happens.)

Underground: Reach the warm earth at the bottom. Avoid the rocks. The
    roots can cross each other in the top region, but not below. Turning
    slows you down, going straight speeds you up.

In the Rain: Collect as much rain as you can by bending left or right.

The Bee: Pollinate the flower by bumping into it. (You control the bee.)
    You are rewarded for each bump.

The End: The flower absorbs the bright spots. You get as many seeds as
    you have collected bright spots.
