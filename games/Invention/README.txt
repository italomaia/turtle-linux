HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

For the escort levels:
  - Drag pieces from the moving conveyor belt on the top to the stage; use them
  to aid Serenity's movements across each stage and into the exit portal for
  each stage! Pieces can be moved around after being placed, so keep trying
  until you get it right!
  - Remember, large falls (greater than twice Phoebe's height) will cause
  Serenity to malfunction and you will have to start over!
  - Falling through the stage will also cause Phoebe to malfunction! Make sure
  to bridge any gaps!
